ðŸ“Œ InstaScan â€“ AI-Powered Medical Imaging for Disease Detection
InstaScan is an AI-powered medical imaging application designed for skin cancer and pneumonia detection. It leverages deep learning models trained on HAM10000 and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to provide accurate disease predictions.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Skin Cancer Detection â€“ Classifies skin lesions using EfficientNetB7 trained on the HAM10000 dataset.
âœ… Pneumonia Detection â€“ Analyzes chest X-rays with EfficientNetB7 trained on the RSNA dataset.
âœ… FastAPI Backend â€“ Serves AI models via two REST APIs, deployed on Render for real-time inference.
âœ… Flutter App â€“ Provides an intuitive and responsive UI for image upload and result visualization.
âœ… Model Performance â€“ Achieves 92.5% accuracy (F1-score: 0.91) for skin cancer and 94.2% accuracy (F1-score: 0.93) for pneumonia detection.
âœ… TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) Support â€“ Optimized for mobile inference to ensure fast and lightweight predictions.
